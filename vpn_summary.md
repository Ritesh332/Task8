# VPN Summary: Benefits, Features, and Limitations

## What is a VPN?
A VPN (Virtual Private Network) encrypts your internet traffic and routes it through a secure tunnel to a remote server, masking your IP address.

## How VPNs Protect Privacy
- Hides real IP address
- Encrypts traffic using secure protocols
- Prevents ISP or third parties from monitoring browsing data
